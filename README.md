## General Information

The primary cause of financial depletion, termed as credit loss, is attributed to loaning money to high-risk borrowers.
This credit loss represents the sum forfeited by the lender when the debtor fails to settle their debt or absconds with the owed amount.
The provided data offers insights into previous loan applicants and their default status.
The primary goal is to pinpoint these high-risk loan applicants, thereby lessening the possibility of credit losses. The objective of this case study is to identify such candidates utilizing EDA.
The firm can apply this understanding for portfolio management and risk evaluation.
 

## Conclusions
- There is a greater volume of fully completed loans compared to defaulted ones.

- An increase in interest risk leads to an increase in defaulted loans.
- The better the rating of the loan, the less likely it is to be defaulted.
- Despite debt consolidation being the most common type of loan, it's the small business loans that contribute the most to defaults.
- The proportion of defaulted loans is highest in New York.
- A higher debt-to-income (dti) ratio leads to an increase in defaulted loans.
- An elevated revolving utilization ratio results in more defaulted loans.
